# topic_modellig_BBC

The primary goal of the project is to identify and extract latent topics present in a corpus of news articles. These topics should represent the major themes or subjects discussed in the news.
By applying topic modeling, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the content within the news articles. This includes uncovering the key issues, events, and trends covered in the news.
Once topics are identified, news articles can be categorized into these topics, making it easier to organize and retrieve articles by subject matter.
