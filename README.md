# topic_modellig_BBC
* The primary goal of the project is to identify and extract latent topics present in a corpus of news articles. These topics should represent the major themes or subjects discussed in the news.
* By applying topic modeling, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the content within the news articles. This includes uncovering the key issues, events, and trends covered in the news.
* Once topics are identified, news articles can be categorized into these topics, making it easier to organize and retrieve articles by subject matter.

* Type :- UNSUPERVISED
* Goals :- Topic Discovery, Content understanding categorization, Content Recommendation.
* Challenges :- Topic number selection, Quality of data, Evaluation metrics, Model interpretability.

* Data visualizaion, storytelling and experimenting with charts. like
  - How much words are used in each categories.
  - Which categories article have maximum word count.
  - what is agregate average of word length in articles.
  - Total stop words in each categories.
  - Variance of upper value in each categories.
  - Mean sentiment polarity of categories.
  - Distribution of article length of diffrent news categories.

* Textual data preprocessinng.
  - Expand contraction.
  - Lower casing.
  - Removing punctuations.
  - Removing URLs, digits, stopwords and white spaces.
  - Tokenization.
  - Text normalization.
  - Part of speech tagging.
  - Text Vectorization.

 * Machine learning Model implementation.
   - Latent Diriclet Allocation (LDA)
   - Latent Sementic Analysis (LSA)
   - None-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is often considered one of the best methods for topic modeling because it gives Coherence score 0.46 on normal model and 0.46 on tunned model. And i have considerd COHERENCE evaluation matrics for positive impact.
